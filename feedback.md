The documentation for iExec in general is quite comprehensive, the template is working, however I encountered many small issues and details that were in the documentation but frangmented in different places, I had help from Sellick, Martin and Eden that's why I was able to complete the project but otherwise it would've taken me much longer to complete and maybe it would not be as extensive as we managed to do it.

The details are simple and should be included in the correct documentation parts, and some missing info also was reported to Martin.

When running the app in arbitrum sepolia if the app takes longer the debug command doesn't work, it will give the error "No task found for id 0xc24..."
